# Hi, I'm Matt 👋

**Biomedical Science · Machine Learning · Distributed Systems**

I enjoy making open-source projects and tools that combine science with software. My interests span various fields, including neuroscience, wave and particle physics, astronomy, and robotics. I studied Biomedical Science and Computer Science at Toronto MU.

I'm currently seeking roles in machine learning, distributed systems, or applied AI, particularly in domains related to biological and physical systems.

### Current Focus

* 🧠 Distributed training & inference with [Tensorlink](https://github.com/smartnodes-lab/tensorlink)
* 🤖 Cloud-free, private chatbots and AI tools with [localhostGPT](https://github.com/mattjhawken/localhostGPT)
